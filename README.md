# YSOs
Repo for our HRL YSO work!

Note: We should probably put all the programming excercise work in a folder, and organize all the real project work into a folder, so when we download them to edit and run them, we can use relative paths. 

**NOTE**: We're currently in the process of shifting this package over to Noah's version, so this package is basically no longer supported.
